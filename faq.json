  "How do I install pirated games?": "We do not provide support for piracy in this server. Read rule 3 in <#703302242123645010> for more information.\n",
  "What software do I need to inject a payload?": "**Windows:** [TegraRcmGUI](https://github.com/eliboa/TegraRcmGUI/releases/latest)\n**macOS / Web (Chromium-based browsers):** [Nintendo Switch Payload Loader](https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/)\n\n[More options](https://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/List_of_Switch_payloads)",
  "How do I install Android on the Switch?": "https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-unofficial-8-1-switchroot-lineageos-15-1.3951389/\n\n**This is not by Team Neptune**",
  "How much space do I need for an emuMMC?": "An emuMMC takes about 30GB of storage, so a 64GB would be the minimum. For the best experience, you should use a 128GB or higher SD card.",
  "What DNS do I use?": "90DNS blocks all connections to Nintendo, while AquaticDNS allows some connections to Nintendo (such as Online) without telemetry.\n\n**Please note:** AquaticDNS is not ran by Team Neptune, so we can't guarantee it'll work as advertised.",
  "Why are my files disappearing from the SD?": "You may have a fake SD card. Try asking about your specific card in the general chat where others can look into it. ",
  "How do I know if a card is fake?": "If you have the following symptoms it may be a fake card:\n\n- Data disappearing randomly\n\n- Data becoming corrupted\n\nThe following are things to look out for when buying a card:\n\n- Too good to be true sizes (ex. 128GB for $5)\n\n- Suspicious brands",
  "What does 0x0000 mean on TegraRCMgui?": "0x0000 means that the switch is patched and can not be hacked using the RCM vulnerability. You can always try using another cable to make sure, but the results are unlikely to change.\n\nThere is the option of mod chips instead, but they're hard to find and require soldering skills. Additionally, it costs about $150+ to buy a mod chip.",
  "Can I go online with mods?": "It's best to use an emuMMC and stay offline when using mods, this can keep your saves intact and prevent doing something to get you banned. However, if you are going to go online, be careful with what mods you use. Depending on what game you're playing, certain things are likely to ban you.\n\n**There is no concrete list of things that can ban you**",
  "Why aren't my games available in emuMMC/showing a cloud icon?": "This means your `Nintendo` folder is not available to the emuMMC. You have to copy `/Nintendo` to `/emuMMC/RAW1/`.\n\nIt should look somewhat like this after you copy the folder\n```\n\nSD CARD\n├── atmosphere\n├── bootloader\n├── config\n├── emuMMC\n│   └── RAW1\n│       └── Nintendo\n├── Nintendo\n└── switch\n\n```",
  "Why should I use an emuMMC?": "There are some benefits to using emuMMC.\n\n**sysNAND (aka internal memory):** Use this to play online without mods. This is where to play online without risking getting banned.\n\n**emuMMC (aka emuNAND):** Copy of your sysNAND that is stored on the SD card. *This should remain offline or use 90DNS at all times*\n\nThis allows you to play online on your sysNAND and do offline risky stuff on your emuNAND\n\nThe following is copied from sysNAND when you create the emuMMC\n- Save files\n- Games, but requires moving a folder (FAQ Search: “Why aren't my games available in emuMMC”)\n- Photos/Videos on Internal Memory\n- Profiles\n- All System Settings\n\n**⚠️ Important:** Do **not** connect the emuMMC to Nintendo in any way. This will most likely cause a ban due to mismatching logs. The best option to prevent connecting is to remove all internet settings *immediately* after creating the emuMMC.",
  "Should I use Hekate or Fusee?": "While both should work fine, Hekate offers more features and is recommended by Team Neptune.",
  "Can I use online services on my switch?": "**⚠️ Important:** Do **not** connect the emuMMC to Nintendo in any way. This will most likely cause a ban due to mismatching logs.\n\nGenerally, you can connect safely to online services if you **haven't** done any of the following:\n\n- Install pirated games at *some* point (even if you uninstalled them)\n- Modify saves in online games\n- Do actions on your account that normal users can't do (custom avatars)\n\n**This is a non-exaustive list as we don't know everything Nintendo bans for. Do at your own risk.**",
  "Can I use exFAT formatted SD card?": "Using an exFAT formatted SD card is not recommended as it can corrupt easier on the Nintendo Switch. Using FAT32 instead is the better option.",
  "How do I get 90DNS?": "**90DNS**: Allows you to connect to internet without connecting to non-Nintendo services.\n\n**1st IP**: `207.246.121.77`\n**2nd IP**: `163.172.141.219`",
  "Do I always need to inject a payload to use CFW?": "Yes, you need *some* payload injector such as a computer, portable, or hard mod.",
  "What is the best guide to use to setup CFW on my switch?": "https://switch.homebrew.guide/",
  "Where can I get sigpatches?": "The Switch AIO updater homebrew allows you to download them. As their general purpose is to allow piracy, Team Neptune will not be providing any help with installation or problems of said patches or pirated games afterwards.",
  "When should I fix archive bits?": "It never hurts to try fixing archive bits when you're having trouble using CFW on your switch, but primarily it's best to use when using macOS to manage the files on your SD card.",
  "How can I fix archive bits?": "If you're able to get into Hekate, go to:\n`Tools` -> `Arch bit * RCM * Touch * Pkg1/2` -> `Fix archive bit`"
}
